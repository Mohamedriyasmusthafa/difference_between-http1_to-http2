  Differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

*Protocol Format:
HTTP/1.1: Uses a textual format for requests and responses. Headers and data are transmitted as plain text.
HTTP/2: Employs a binary format, which is more compact and efficient for data transmission. Binary framing allows multiplexing.

*Multiplexing:
HTTP/1.1: Processes requests sequentially, leading to potential delays due to head-of-line blocking.
HTTP/2: Fully multiplexed, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single connection.
 This minimizes latency.

*Parallelism:
HTTP/1.1: Requires separate TCP connections for each resource (e.g., images, stylesheets), resulting in overhead.
HTTP/2: Uses a single connection for parallelism. Multiple resources can be fetched simultaneously, improving performance.

*Header Compression:
HTTP/1.1: Headers are verbose and add to the payload size.
HTTP/2: Utilizes header compression (HPACK) to reduce data size. Smaller headers mean faster transmission.

*Server Push:
HTTP/1.1: Doesnâ€™t support proactive resource pushing.
HTTP/2: Servers can push resources (e.g., stylesheets, images) to the client cache before
 they are explicitly requested, enhancing page load speed.

In summary, HTTP/2 is a significant improvement over HTTP/1.1, offering better performance, reduced latency, and efficient resource handling.
 Developers and website owners should consider adopting HTTP/2 for faster, more responsive web experiences.
